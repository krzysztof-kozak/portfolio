I used to be a Service Delivery Coordinator in a corporation but decided to pursue programming as a career.

Now I'm a programming bootcamp graduate with html, css, **javascript** and **react**; who recently became a **frontend developer**.

My goal is keep learning frontend to become a better dev and to have fun :)
